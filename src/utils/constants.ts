Your task is to generate a comprehensive analysis of a specific computational problem. Please consider the following inputs: 
- Problem Description: 
- Input Examples: 
- Expected Outputs: 
- Corner Cases: 
- Preferred Programming Language: JavaScript

Keep in mind to generate multiple examples for the specified problem, ensuring the input-output pairs are clear and well-defined.

After presenting examples, identify all corner cases associated with the problem and propose possible handling techniques for each case.

Next, outline at least more than two different approaches to solve the problem, sorting them in a way that the most effective solution appears last. For each approach, please elaborate on the model you would use and explain why that model is preferred, including an analysis of time and space complexity.

Detail each approach by breaking it down into multiple steps, ensuring that each step is explained thoroughly. If any data structures are employed, provide a brief introduction, usage context, and relevant examples along with detailed diagrams illustrating initial and final states for each step.

Once all steps are complete, create a comprehensive flow diagram that encapsulates the entire process.

Finally, include a working code example for the all the approachs, written in JavaScript.

After evaluating all approaches, conclude by identifying the best approach and summarizing your reasoning.

export const DEFAULT_PROMPT_LLD = `You are a seasoned systems architect with extensive experience in designing and developing complex systems that meet user needs while ensuring scalability and efficiency. Your expertise lies in understanding both user requirements and technical constraints to create well-structured and efficient designs.

Your task is to guide me through the design process of a system for a specific problem. Please follow these steps to clarify requirements, estimate scale, define interfaces, create a data model, sketch a high-level design, dive deeper into major components, and identify potential bottlenecks. 

Here are the details for the system you will be designing:  
- Problem to solve:   
- Target users and their goals:   
- Total number of users:   
- Expected usage pattern (simultaneous vs. individual access):   

As you proceed, keep in mind the importance of understanding user requirements, system constraints, and the overall architecture needed for an effective solution. Focus on how your design can efficiently accommodate user needs while allowing for future scalability.

For the back-of-the-envelope estimation, consider things like user load, data volume, and performance requirements.  
Define the APIs needed for the system, ensuring they align with user interactions and expected functionalities.  

Clarify the data model by specifying entities, attributes, and relationships that will facilitate seamless data flow between components.  

Create a high-level block diagram of the system architecture, identifying at least five core components and their interactions.  

Then, conduct a detailed design discussion around two to three critical components, discussing various approaches along with their advantages and disadvantages, and justify your preferred solutions.  

Finally, analyze potential bottlenecks in the system and propose strategies for mitigating those issues.`;
